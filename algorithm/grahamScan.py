Graham’s Scan computes the convex hull for a collection of Cartesian points. It
locates the lowest point, low, in the input set P and sorts the remaining points { P –
low } in reverse polar angle with respect to the lowest point. With this order in place,
the algorithm can traverse P clockwise from its lowest point. Every left turn of the
last three points in the hull being constructed reveals that the last hull point was
incorrectly chosen so it can be removed.

:param: A convex hull problem instance is defined by a collection of points, P.
:return: The output will be a sequence of (x, y) points representing a clockwise traversal of
         the convex hull. It shouldn’t matter which point is first.

This algorithm is suitable for Cartesian points. If the points, for example, use a different
coordinate system where increasing y values reflect lower points in the plane,
then the algorithm should compute low accordingly. Sorting the points by polar
angle requires trigonometric calculations.
